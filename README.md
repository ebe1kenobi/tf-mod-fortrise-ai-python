This is a python AI for towerfall (just some if, not a real AI)

* playTag mod supported
* WiderSetMod supported

A port of the mod of vcanaa : https://github.com/TowerfallAi/  which I add menu integration in https://github.com/ebe1kenobi/tf-mod-ai-python and https://github.com/ebe1kenobi/towerfall-mod-kenobi.
I remove the training part of the original mod temporarily
I build the mod loader AI based on this previous work.

See https://github.com/ebe1kenobi/tf-mod-ai-python for developer and how to improve the python program.

* In the mod directory, move the Newtonsoft.Json.dll file in the towerfall.exe directory
* Execute the TowerFall.bat in the mod directory, it will execute the python program which execute the towerfall.exe and connect the AI agent client to the server added in towerfall

The game will wait for the client to connect
